👋 Hi, I’m @PATRICIOcomplex
👀 I’m interested in coding, skateboarding, walking, hiking, and a little 🍃.
🌱 I’m currently learning to become a better front-end developer and improve my AI skills to create my first real AI bot.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that align with my interests. While I have some ongoing projects, I am open to suggestions and always    looking for ways to improve my skills and contribute to something meaningful.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to email me at mejared09@gmail.com if you have any questions, want to collaborate, or just say hi!
